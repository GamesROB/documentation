# Code of Conduct
This is the code of conduct you should follow when contributing, making PRs, naming commits, creating issues, really anything related to this repository.


## Do's
- [x] **DO** be nice when interacting with others.
- [x] **DO** assume people have good intentions, this can be especially difficult when someone doesn't natively speak the same language.
- [x] **DO** try to use general/broad/inclusive keywords like "they" instead of "she" or "he".
- [x] **DO** think about what will be ideal for the entire community instead of just you

## Don'ts
- [ ] **DON'T** use any profane language, this includes 'lighter' swears like hell, crap, frick, etc.
- [ ] **DON'T** reject criticism, if you disagree with what someone suggested, assume it was constructive and *explain* why you disagree, don't attack them.
- [ ] **DON'T** discriminate against people for any reason, all you should be concerned about is if they're helpful in the context of this repository.
