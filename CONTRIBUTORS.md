# Contributors
*Revision 1.0.0*

Contributions are awesome! This file is our way of letting contributors sign off on their changes and credit themselves!


## I can get credit in the repo itself?
Of course! You have a few options for exactly what you want to credit yourself as, you can pick one of the following:
- GitHub username (optionally with linked profile) - e.g. bigfinfrank or [bigfinfrank](https://github.com/bigfinfrank)
- Email (optionally linked) - e.g. 18708515+bigfinfrank@users.noreply.github.com or [18708515+bigfinfrank@users.noreply.github.com](mailto:18708515+bigfinfrank@users.noreply.github.com). This will only be allowed if it's from a prominent email service such as Gmail, ProtonMail, Outlook, etc.
- Real name (optionally with a linked email or github profile) - e.g. Fin Notsoktski or [Fin Notskotski](mailto:18708515+bigfinfrank@users.noreply.github.com)
- Name (and optionally link) of a GitHub Organization you own or have official endorsement to represent from said organization's owner - e.g. GamesROB or [GamesROB](https://github.com/GamesROB)
We do not allow linking to external sites except for in very specific cases (e.g. if you owned a large, well known and well represented organization). This is primarily for security as linking to external sites is significantly less safe than keeping things within GitHub or using emails.
However you are free to open an issue and try to convince us to make an exception, but it is *very* unlikely one will be made for you.


## What if I don't want to be credited?
We completely understand, sometimes it's simply preferable to go without recognition, for this reason you don't necessarily need to *credit* yourself, **but** you still need to "sign" this, details are below.


## "Signing" off on your changes
All of your commits will need to be signed before we can merge them, additionally you need to "sign" this file.

### Why?
To discourage bad actors and give us something to reference if we ever regretfully need to, we require all contributors to virtually "sign" CONTRIBUTORS.md. This is both for our security and for yours in case you need to defend yourself is someone managed to get unpermitted access to your account. It is also our belief that this leads people to be more honest and results in 'safer' contributions overall.


### How?
You'll need to generate a GPG key, upload the public key to GitHub, and push a signed commit. That might sound like a lot but it's not that difficult, GitHub has a handful of pages in their documentation on how to accomplish this [here](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification).


### What?
Now that you're set up to make signed commits, lets get into what signing this means and exactly what you have to do to sign this.
By signing this, you're agreeing that:

You will abide by our:
- [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/LICENSE.md) agreement
- [`SECURITY`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentationl/security/policy) policy
- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines

You will (to the best of your ability, within reason) follow our:
- [`ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)s
- [`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)s

Additionally you agree, will follow, and acknowledge that:
- You waive all rights (copyright and otherwise) to the [`AUTHORS`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/AUTHORS.md) of this repository while still retaining legal and non-legal responsibility for all of your contributions
- You are not guaranteed and most likely will not receive any portion(s) of the contributions to our [`FUNDING`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/FUNDING.md)
- When virtually signing this [`CONTRIBUTORS`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) file, you are not in a position where your judgement is impaired
- You will properly use the [`ACKNOWLEDGMENTS`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md) file when applicable to the best of your ability

If you don't agree to all of the above, then you should stop reading this and shouldn't follow the instructions below.

---

To sign this file and agree to everything above, you must make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/compare), with a [signed commit](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) you've pushed that adds either:
- `- <credit>` where `<credit>` is replaced with the type of credit you'd like yourself credited as (see "I can get credit in the repo itself?"), optionally linked
- `- anon` if you'd like to not receive credit
