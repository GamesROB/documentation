# Language

Usage: `${prefix}language [reset/code]`

`[reset]` - You can add the text "reset" to reset your language to use a server's default.
`[code]` - The code of the language you want to use.


Change the language you want to use with the bot, reset it to the server default, or (if you don't include a code or "reset",) lists all current languages.
