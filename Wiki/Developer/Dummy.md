# Dummy

Usage: `${prefix}dummy [id] [action]`

`[id]` - The numerical ID of a dummy
`[action]` - The action you want the dummy to make, for example in TicTacToe this could be `b`


`${prefix}dummy` by itself adds a dummy to the game running in the current channel. Using the full `${prefix}dummy [id] [action]` lets you control the moves of the dummies to test multiplayer games alone
