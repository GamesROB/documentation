# GamesROB Privacy Policy
*Last updated and effective: July 27, 2021*


Thank you for using Discord bots (the "bot(s)") made by the GamesROB Team ("GamesROB", "we", "us"), to keep the bot functional and provide the best possible experience, we collect some necessary data from Discord users (the "User", "you", "they", "their") who have interacted with the bot and the respective Discord Guilds (the "Server(s)") that any of our bots have been added to.
To improve the experience of the Bot, we also collect some information through the [GamesROB Website](https://gamesrob.com) (the "Site"), that interfaces with the bot. Some data referenced within this Privacy Policy will be exclusive to those who are actively or have previously supported us monetarily via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/gamesrob) (our "Patron(s)").
This Privacy Policy was initially created to comply with the [Discord Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.dev/legal), but is designed to publicly outline our policies regarding information we collect via the bot, website, or any other software we have developed (collectively, our "Service(s)").


## You and Your Data
To request a copy of your data, you can use the 'GDPR' command on one of our bots, if you are unsure how to do this we'd be happy to assist you in our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/7uzKWGB) or via email at [gdpr@gamesrob.com](mailto:gdpr@gamesrob.com).

To request deletion of your data you can either use the 'GDPR' command on one of our bots, or email [gdpr@gamesrob.com](mailto:gdpr@gamesrob.com) with your Discord User ID and proof you own the account associated with the given User ID.


## Information We Collect
As stated above we collect some information from you to improve the overall experience of our Services. The information we collect will be split into the three subsections below for simplicity and accessibility.

### From You

- Discord User IDs

  To group together the rest of a User's data and allow it to be easily accessed we store your User ID (ex. 383995098754711555) this is **not** your username (ex. 'GamesROB') or your Discriminator (ex. '#3608').

- Language Preference

  To make the bot accessible for people all around the world with different lingual preferences we support a number of language translations submitted by our community that you can use as an alternative to the default language, American English. If this is set we obviously store it.

- Virtual Currency

  Our Services have an Economy function that is by default called 'Tokens'. We store the amount of tokens you currently have as well as the 'transactions' made which is a log of how, when, and how much currency was gained or lost.

  We also have a separate currency called 'Candies' which is exclusive to the Halloween event that we run every year. Candies are simply stored simply as a number with no associated transaction logs. For Patrons, we have a weekly token bonus which stores the last time you collected your weekly bonus.

- Upvote Rewards

  To reward Users who have repeatedly 'upvoted' the bot on a website like [Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/gamesrob) on a daily basis, we store the last time a User has upvoted and how many consecutive days they have upvoted for. This lets us incrementally give you better rewards the longer you have been upvoting for.

- Site Sessions

  In order to prevent requiring Users from needing to re-login to the Site every time you close the Site in your browser, we store a randomly generated unique identifier for each User when they login, logging in again replaces the previous session token and therefore invalidates any previous sessions.

- Profile

  We let Users customize the background image for your profiles. To make this work, we store the URL of the currently set background image, assuming one has been set by the User.
  Due to some preset backgrounds being earnt, we store whether or not these presets have been unlocked. We assign profile badges to Users for various things, most commonly for Users who have accomplished all achievements, we store which badges you've unlocked.

- Achievements

  To give Users a goal to work towards we store the total number of times each game has been played, the total time each User has spent playing games, how many times the User has used the bot, and the first time they interacted with the bot. These are all intended for achievements. We also store the progression you have made towards unlocking various achievements.

- Other

  To punish Users with nefarious intent, we have a blacklisting function that lets owners and in certain scenarios volunteer staff block people from using the bot. To do this, we store a count of how many previous blacklists each User has previously had, the expiration of their latest blacklist, and the blacklist reason.

  When using our GDPR command to request data deletion, we store the time that your data will be deleted, this will be deleted along with the rest of their data when that time is reached.

### From Servers

- Discord Server IDs

  To keep a Server's data grouped together we store each Server's ID (ex. '345259986303057930') this is **not** a Server's name (ex. 'The GamesROB Server') or an invite link to a Server (ex. 'https://discord.com/invite/QWPVH5j').

- Language Preference

  To keep the bot accessible for people around the world with different lingual preferences we support a number of language translations you can use as an alternative to the default American English, if you do we will store the Server's default language preference.

- Virtual Currency

  Our Services have an Economy function that is by default called 'Tokens', if a Server has been registered as Premium by us or a Patron, then the name of that Server's economy and the icon be changed, so if applicable we store the economy name and economy icon if relevant.

- Premium

  In order to know if a Server is Premium, the User ID of either us or the Patron who registered a Server as Premium will be stored with that Server's data. Some other Patron perks that have related data stored are; the Tournament system which stores when the latest tournament ends, custom Server background images which have the background image stored,
  and custom leaderboard channels which requires us to store the following data for the leaderboard message: a message ID (ex. '520598741909241857') and a channel ID (ex. '516736142800846849') **not** the channel name (ex. '#server-info').

### Miscellaneous

- Game Replays

  As a future feature and to help us replicate bugs, we store the necessary data to 'replay' a match. This includes when a game was started and ended, what game and gamemode was played, all the actions/moves taken by each User in that game, as well as the Users participated and the User won the game.

- Highscores

  To keep the bot competitive and give Users ways to challenge themselves, we keep track of every User's best scores in each game.

- Translations

  Due to us crowd-sourcing translations, for every translation submission we get sent via the Site we store the language and what key that particular translation was for, if the submission wasn't anonymous then we log the User that submitted the translation, and the community rating we have for each translation submission.
