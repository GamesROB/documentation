# Authors
*Authors revision 1.0.0*

Here you can find a list of substantial authors of the project, specifically those who would be considered legally significant under common copyright laws. *Although it is worth noting that upon signing [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) you waived all the rights (copyright and otherwise) of your contributions.*


## How do I get my name here?
Well in short, you probably won't. This file denotes the legal owners of content within this repository. If you aren't mentioned here then your entry in [`CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) is purely for documentation (although still required).


## What if I was told I could have my name here?
Well if that's the case, congratulations! You're one of the very few people who will ever have been given this privilege. Putting your name in here is pretty similar to putting your name in [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md).
Here's the step-by-step:
1. Ensure you're still set up to make [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
2. Ensure that you're credited with the same name/reference throughout both [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) and [`CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).
3. Similarly to how you signed [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md), you'll need to add your name to the "List of Authors".
Use the format `- <credit>` where `<credit>` is replaced with the type of credit you're referenced by in [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) and [`CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).
If you linked something with your credit in [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md), you need to also do so here with the link being identical.
4. Make a PR with your changes, and wait for us to review it.
