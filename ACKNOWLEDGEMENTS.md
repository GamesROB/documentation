# Acknowledgements
Here is where we acknowledge resources used in this repostiory. We will do our best to keep this up-to-date but it may not be (especially in cases where the acknowledgement of a resource is not strictly required).

## Formatting
Starting with the next header, acknowledgements are listed. These are single-line acknowledgements that are hyperlinked with their source linked as well if possible (similarly to [`CREDITS.md`](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/mkdocs/docs/other/credits.md).
Follow the [commit-prefixing](https://github.com/GamesROB/documentation/blob/mkdocs/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-prefixing) guidelines to figure out where an acknowledgement should be placed.
Each Acknowledgement should be listed under it's own
- bullet.
